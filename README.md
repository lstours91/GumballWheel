## Description

For this project, the main goal will be to construct and code a ferris wheel that can dispense gumballs when you wave your hand
in front of a sensor.


## Constraints and Criteria

- The ferris wheel must have a diameter lower than or equal to 300mm and a thickness of 3.18mm
- We have to be careful about he material if we take it home since we are buying it
- We have a limited set of colors we can use


## Ideas we had

- A windmill that drops in gummy bears in the hatch
- A shape more like a ferris wheel that drops gumballs
  - We picked the second one because gumballs are easier to measure and more consistant with their shape and size


## List of materials

- Two servos
- 3D printing material
-
